*hello me, I missed you I don’t know why whenever I wanted to do this I just distract myself and did not do it let’s start straight to the point the girl never mentioned in [Feelings](https://www.notion.so/Feelings-71153a4ee2684e8e83268c00cef8313d?pvs=21) it is now your girl, your first love but there’s always a but 1 and a half month so far and this is nothing rather than the love of my life nothing ever could describe my love I’m going to explain in few keys called items*

## Peaceful mind

*I never have had a love that’s so peaceful as this one not just because I already sure that’s she was mine but because every girl I’ve loved was always a losing race for me that kept a deep scar in my sub-mind it was always me loeving someone not me & someone loves together and yay nope
now it's different she loves me she knows me very well we share this love I know her very well also to the point that I even don’t have to think twice about her*

## Love and support

*her love and her support is like nothing before I started to get addicted to her to the point that I feel lost without her and that feeling only got triggered 0.01% of the time when this is so important to share because she is here always available always hearing waiting listening texting me even if I decided to take some break from her I found her never leaving me alone she never annoys me and she is always a supportive caring girl*

## mindset and lifestyle

*I don’t know how god could organize everything in one sequence with downs and ups to gift the most perfect girl for me I could ever imagine fuck the chicks and the hots girls on the internet those never matter and they will never be as perfect as my beautiful girl with her beautiful mind in this modern toxic social environment my baby still has one of the rarest mindsets which I always respect and it matches my thinking rules the fact that I want to wait to have sex with her never makes me feels bad*
