we tested every sorting algorithms with different file 
so we can determin wich sorting is using either:
[Selection sort]	[Bubble sort]	[Merge sort]
sort1 is Bubble sort with time complexity of best case O(n)11
sort2 is Merge sort with average time complexity of O(nlog(n))133
sort3 is Selection sort with average time complexity of O(n*2)68
